# Metrics Capturing System

***Metrics Capturing System*** is a software application designed to collect and manage metrics from various devices. This system efficiently processes incoming data streams, organizing, aggregating, and categorizing the data. Subsequently, it stores the processed metrics in a time-series database.

Below is the high level architecture view of ***Metrics Capturing System***.

## Component Details

| Component Name  | Component Description | Technology Choices |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ***Event Streaming Gateway***  | The Gateway Component serves as a bridge between IoT devices and the streaming platform, facilitating network connectivity. This gateway enables IoT data streams to be directed towards the Metrics Capture System. Essentially, it acts as a translator, converting the communication protocols employed by IoT devices into enterprise-compatible protocols that are utilized by Event Brokers. | MQTT Broker like HiveMQ, or Eclipse Mosquitto. |
| ***Event Streaming System***  | Highly scalable data ingestion platform designed to support low latency and high-volume data ingestion from a vast array of sensors or IoT devices. It dynamically scales in response to the workload demands from IoT devices, optimizing resource utilization to efficiently manage the massive influx of data. | Apache Kafka, or Azure Event Hubs. |
| ***Stream Processing System***  | Entirely compatible with the event streaming system, including its protocols and API services utilized for data consumption. This compatibility facilitates a smooth integration with the event broker, enabling the categorization of data into three primary segments: the cold path, the warm path, and the hot path. | Go, Rust, or .NET Api services. |
| ***Cold Path Data Processing System***  | Facilitates long-term data archival and batch processing of data classified as "Cold Path" by the Stream Processing System. This dataset is entirely managed by this system for compliance and reporting needs, potentially serving as a source for the batch processing pipeline for future data analytics. | Go, Rust, or .NET Api services. |
| ***Warm Path Data Processing System***  | This process involves handling data that can tolerate longer processing delays for more comprehensive analysis. Its primary function is to write the received data into a time-series data store, ensuring efficient indexing and analysis. The system's primary objective is to store raw data received from IoT devices, forming the essential foundation of information required by the Hospital System. | Go, Rust, or .NET Api services. |
| ***Hot Path Data Processing System***  | At this level, near real-time analysis is applied to the retrieved data, requiring processing with low latency and high volume. This solution employs a stream processing engine to detect anomalies in the data, which triggers alerts in the event of any emergencies in the metrics. This allows for human intervention to assist patients. Furthermore, the output can also be written to a more structured format data store, facilitating further analysis through querying. | Go, Rust, or .NET Api services. |
| ***Data Transformation System***  | Since the data stored in the warm data store is in raw format, originating from IoT devices, a transformation layer is necessary for converting the data schema whenever the Hospital System requests patient records. | Go, Rust, or .NET Api services. |
| ***Performance Metrics Data Visualization System***  | The performance metrics of the software components within the Metrics Capturing System need to be monitored. Therefore, this system visualizes these performance metrics on near real-time dashboards, providing clearer insights into the system's and devices' stability. | Grafana, Power BI. |
| ***Warm Path Database***  | Timeseries based NoSQL database which is used to store the patient vitals data classified as warm for later use in the Hospital System. | Influx DB, Couchbase Lite, MongoDB  |
| ***Cold Path Data Warehouse***  | Cold storage location where data could be archived. | AWS S3, Azure Blob, Azure DataLake  |

## Architectural Characteristics

| Characteristics  | Decisions |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Fault Tolerance  | Applications must incorporate appropriate resiliency patterns, such as retries and circuit-breaker patterns, to ensure they can handle all failure scenarios effectively. This approach ensures the implementation of suitable fallback logic, maintaining the overall performance of the system.  |
| Recoverability  | Applications operating within Metrics Capturing System should possess the capability to recover from unexpected failures or crashes. This can be accomplished by employing an orchestrator that can automatically restart the applications whenever they crash unexpectedly. Kubernestes or docker compose could be an example |
| Security  | Patient metrics information is a sensitive data that requires protection. It must be encrypted both at rest and during transit to ensure its security. Further security could be achieved by encrypting information at the data store level.  |
| Deployability  | New changes made to applications should be rapidly deployed across all software components of the Metrics Capturing System. This can be achieved by adopting the GitOps model for continuous deployment.
